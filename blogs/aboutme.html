        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Omar—a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a passion for technology and innovation. 
            My interests span cybersecurity, programming, Azure Cloud, AI in security, and cloud computing. 
            I am especially fascinated by the integration of AI in cybersecurity, implementing automated SIEM tools, and leveraging intelligent solutions to protect digital assets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of tech, I'm a long-time basketball player and athlete who enjoys the challenge of both the court and the keyboard. I love programming, building new things, and the thrill of securing applications or testing the limits of seemingly invulnerable systems.
        </p>
