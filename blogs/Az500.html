            <h2>Studying for AZ-500</h2>
            <p>Let me start by saying that I passed the AZ-500 on my second try. The certification exam was 
                undoubtly one of the most difficult exam I've ever taken and I'm not saying this to scare you off.<br>
                Passing this exam is very achievable, but will take an immense amount of time and effort. <br>
                Before taking this exam you will need solid foundation of Cloud solutions and security conecpts.

            certification covers a wide variety of Azure Security topics, such as: <br> 
            <br>
