# ToDo List for Portfolio Site and Blog

1. Blog page CSS needs to have the same design as the main page and corresponding pages.
2. Finish up the main section and host on a free teir subsription or figure out own way to secure and host your site.
3. Add under construction message when user wants to visit my blog site, as it needs refinement.
